<h1>The Best Crafts Accordingt to Brittney</h1>
<h2>My top 3 craft hobbies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fiber art</h3>
<p>Fiber art is one of my favorites because it encompasses many different crafts such as: crochet, knitting, cross stitching, and embroidery.</p>
<h3>Digital Art</h3>
<p>Digital art interests me greatly because of how easy it is to alter and try new things without having to completely start a project over.</p>
<h3>Painting</h3>
<p>Painting is on its own because there are many different kinds of painting such as watercolor, acrylic, oil, etc. I don't have a distinct preference because I liek the different painting mediums for different projects.</p>
